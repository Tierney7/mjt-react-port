Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the University of Kansas, with newly developed skills in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design to name a few.

With each project, my goal is to grab my audience's attention with stunning design for a unique user experience. I have applied aspects of several languages for my personal projects, both front and back-end. I’ve contributed to 3 separate group projects. Building everything from a local restaurant review website utilizing API’s, a recipe generator using Handlebars, and a social network designed to help coding students, and professionals stay in touch.
